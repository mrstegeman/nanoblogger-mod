NanoBlogger is a small weblog engine written in Bash for the command
line. It uses common UNIX tools such as cat, grep, and sed to create
static HTML content.

Installing NanoBlogger
----------------------

1. download gzipped tarball:
   http://nanoblogger.sourceforge.net/downloads/nanoblogger-xx.tar.gz
2. decompress gzipped tarball: tar xzf nanoblogger-xx.tar.gz
3. Modify shell's path to include the installation path.[1]

   NOTE: this step will be taken care for you when you install through a
         package manager, like apt-get.

Generic Upgrade Instructions
----------------------------

Follow these three steps:

1. create a new weblog directory using nanoblogger (skip the
   configuration):
	nb --interactive 0 -b [new-blog-dir] add weblog

2. copy the old data directory over to the new weblog directory:
	cp -r [old-blog-dir]/data [new-blog-dir]

3. edit the new blog.conf to your likings and rebuild
   the weblog:
	nb -b [new-blog-dir] configure update all

Upgrade Notes
-------------

### Style Sheets & Templates ###
 
In addition to your *old* data directory, you will probably want to also
copy over your styles and templates directory. If you decide to do this,
you may find that your style sheets or templates no longer work as
expected. In which case some adjustments will have to be made before
they work properly with the new version. A side-by-side comparison
between the old and new version will be your best recourse. Consider
this a small trade-off for the ability to fully customize the weblog's
appearance.

### Configuration ###

Similarly, you will probably want to keep many settings from your old
blog.conf. In which case, I suggest you do a side-by-side comparison of
your old blog.conf and the new blog.conf. Then manually migrate your
settings over to the new blog.conf.

### Plugins ###

If you created your own plugins, please take into account any changes to
variables, settings, etc., that your plugins may depend on.
